`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` are two ways to transfer a token from a person to another.

`transferFrom` transfers a token without any extra information or extra checks.

`safeTransferFrom` transfers a token in a safer way, lets you add extra information and makes sure the address receiving the token can actually use it or receive it.
